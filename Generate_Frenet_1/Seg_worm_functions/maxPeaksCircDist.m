function [peaks indices] = maxPeaksCircDist(x, dist, varargin)
%MAXPEAKSCIRCDIST Find the maximum peaks in a circular vector. The peaks
%are separated by, at least, the given distance.
%
%   [PEAKS INDICES] = MAXPEAKSCIRCDIST(X, DIST)
%
%   [PEAKS INDICES] = MAXPEAKSCIRCDIST(X, DIST, CHAINCODELENGTHS)
%
%   Inputs:
%       x                - the vector of values
%       dist             - the minimum distance between peaks
%       chainCodeLengths - the chain-code length at each index;
%                          if empty, the array indices are used instead
%
%   Outputs:
%       peaks   - the maximum peaks
%       indices - the indices for the peaks
