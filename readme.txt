Readme

Run the Main_Coil.m to see the tracking performance.

Change the filename accordingly to save the tracking video.

If new input video needs to be processed, change 'vr' accordinly. 
And the 'Frenet_Coil' needs to be generated based on conventional tracking algorithm to have the initial skeleton.

See the Flow_Chart to have an idea of the functions.
